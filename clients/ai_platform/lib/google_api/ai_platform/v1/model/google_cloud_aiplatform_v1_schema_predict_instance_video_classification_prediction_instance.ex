  Prediction input format for Video Classification.

  ## Attributes

  *   `content` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The Google Cloud Storage location of the video on which to perform the prediction.
  *   `mimeType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The MIME type of the content of the video. Only the following are supported: video/mp4 video/avi video/quicktime
  *   `timeSegmentEnd` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The end, exclusive, of the video's time segment on which to perform the prediction. Expressed as a number of seconds as measured from the start of the video, with "s" appended at the end. Fractions are allowed, up to a microsecond precision, and "inf" or "Infinity" is allowed, which means the end of the video.
  *   `timeSegmentStart` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The beginning, inclusive, of the video's time segment on which to perform the prediction. Expressed as a number of seconds as measured from the start of the video, with "s" appended at the end. Fractions are allowed, up to a microsecond precision.
