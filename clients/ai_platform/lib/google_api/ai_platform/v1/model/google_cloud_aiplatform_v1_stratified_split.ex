defmodule GoogleApi.AiPlatform.V1.Model.GoogleCloudAiplatformV1StratifiedSplit do
  @moduledoc """
  Assigns input data to the training, validation, and test sets so that the distribution of values found in the categorical column (as specified by the `key` field) is mirrored within each split. The fraction values determine the relative sizes of the splits. For example, if the specified column has three values, with 50% of the rows having value "A", 25% value "B", and 25% value "C", and the split fractions are specified as 80/10/10, then the training set will constitute 80% of the training data, with about 50% of the training set rows having the value "A" for the specified column, about 25% having the value "B", and about 25% having the value "C". Only the top 500 occurring values are used; any values not in the top 500 values are randomly assigned to a split. If less than three rows contain a specific value, those rows are randomly assigned. Supported only for tabular Datasets.

  ## Attributes

  *   `key` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The key is a name of one of the Dataset's data columns. The key provided must be for a categorical column.
  *   `testFraction` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The fraction of the input data that is to be used to evaluate the Model.
  *   `trainingFraction` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The fraction of the input data that is to be used to train the Model.
  *   `validationFraction` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - The fraction of the input data that is to be used to validate the Model.
